Hello my name is Isaiah Dillard,
  I am Marine Corps veteran and a student at Wake Technical Community College. I started my journey towards becoming a developer in August of 2021 after being a Diesel Technician. After completing School at Wake Tech I plan to continue my schooling and at a University.
  
 Here you will be able to find past programs and projects that I have created for either class or in my free time. I frequently update my repositories as I learn and create new programs. 
 
 I have seperated my programs in repositories based off the language used.
 Each repository has multiple programs located in folders 

Current skills:
- Python
- C++
- Javascript
- HTML and CSS
- Object Oriented Programming
- Data Structures
