Hello my name is Isaiah Dillard,
  I am a student at Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh, Noth Carolina. I started my journey towards becoming a developer in August of 2021 after being a diesel technician for 6 years.Upon finishing school at Wake Tech I hope to continue my education at NC State. I am also a United States Marine Corps veteran. After serving 4 years honorably I decided to move to Raleigh.
